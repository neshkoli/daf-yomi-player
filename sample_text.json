                    "The beginning of tractate <i>Berakhot</i>, the first tractate in the first of the six orders of Mishna, opens with a discussion of the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, as the recitation of <i>Shema</i> encompasses an acceptance of the yoke of Heaven and of the mitzvot, and as such, forms the basis for all subsequent teachings. The Mishna opens with the laws regarding the appropriate time to recite <i>Shema</i>: <br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From when,</b> that is, from what time, does <b>one recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening? From the time when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma.</i></b> Until when does the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> extend? <b>Until the end of the first watch.</b> The term used in the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:7) to indicate the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <i>beshokhbekha</i>, when you lie down, which refers to the time in which individuals go to sleep. Therefore, the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> is the first portion of the night, when individuals typically prepare for sleep. <b>That is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>",
                    "<b>The Rabbis say:</b> The time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <b>until midnight.</b>",
                    "<b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> One may recite <i>Shema</i> <b>until dawn,</b> indicating that <i>beshokhbekha</i> is to be understood as a reference to the entire time people sleep in their beds, the whole night.",
                    "The mishna relates that Rabban Gamliel practiced in accordance with his ruling. There was an <b>incident</b> where Rabban Gamliel’s <b>sons returned</b> very late <b>from a wedding hall. They said to him,</b> as they had been preoccupied with celebrating with the groom and bride: <b>We did not recite <i>Shema.</i> He said to them: If the dawn has not</b> yet <b>arrived, you are obligated to recite</b> <i>Shema</i>. Since Rabban Gamliel’s opinion disagreed with that of the Rabbis, he explained to his sons that the Rabbis actually agree with him, <b>and</b> that it is <b>not only</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, <b>but rather, wherever the Sages say until midnight, the mitzva</b> may be performed <b>until dawn.</b>",
                    "Rabban Gamliel cites several cases in support of his claim, such as <b>the burning of fats and limbs</b> on the altar. Due to the quantity of offerings each day, the priests were often unable to complete the burning of all of the fats and limbs, so they continued to be burned into the night, as it is written: “This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall remain upon the pyre on the altar all night until morning, while the fire on the altar burns it” (Leviticus 6:2). <b>And,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> sacrifices, such as the sin-offerings and the guilt-offerings <b>that are eaten for one day</b> and night; although the Sages state that they may be eaten only until midnight, by Torah law they may be eaten <b>until dawn.</b> This is in accordance with the verse: “On the day on which it is offered must you eat. Do not leave it until the morning” (Leviticus 7:15). <b>If so, why did the Sages say</b> that they may be eaten only <b>until midnight?</b> This is <b>in order to distance a person from transgression,</b> as if one believes that he has until dawn to perform the mitzva, he might be negligent and postpone it until the opportunity to perform the mitzva has passed.",
                    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Mishna opens with the laws concerning the appropriate time to recite <i>Shema</i> with the question: From when does one recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening? With regard to this question, the Gemara asks: <b>On the basis of what</b> prior knowledge <b>does</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of our mishna ask: <b>From when?</b> It would seem from his question that the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening was already established, and that the <i>tanna</i> seeks only to clarify details that relate to it. But our mishna is the very first mishna in the Talmud.",
                    "The Gemara asks: <b>And furthermore, what distinguishes the evening</b> <i>Shema</i>, that it was taught <b>first? Let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> regarding the recitation of <b>the morning</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>first.</b> Since most mitzvot apply during the day, the <i>tanna</i> should discuss the morning <i>Shema</i> before discussing the evening <i>Shema</i>, just as the daily morning offering is discussed before the evening offering (<i>Tosefot HaRosh</i>).",
                    "The Gemara offers a single response to both questions: <b>The <i>tanna</i> bases himself on the verse as it is written:</b> “You will talk of them when you sit in your home, and when you walk along the way, <b>when you lie down, and when you arise”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7). By teaching the laws of the evening <i>Shema</i> first, the <i>tanna</i> has established that the teachings of the Oral Torah correspond to that which is taught in the Written Torah. <b>And</b> based on the Written Torah, <b>the <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> the oral law: <b>When is the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> of lying down</b> as commanded in the Torah? <b>From when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> Just as the Written Torah begins with the evening <i>Shema</i>, so too must the Oral Torah.",
                    "However, there is another possible explanation for why the mishna opens with the evening <i>Shema</i> rather than with the morning <i>Shema</i>. <b>If you wish,</b> you could <b>say</b> instead that the <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> the precedence of the evening <i>Shema</i> <b>from the</b> order of the <b>creation of the world. As it is written</b> in the story of creation: <b>“And there was evening, and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). According to this verse, day begins with the evening and not the morning. For both of these reasons it was appropriate to open the discussion of the laws of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> with the evening <i>Shema</i>.",
                    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the <b>latter clause</b> of the mishna, which appears later in the chapter, <b>teach: In the morning one recites two</b> blessings <b>before</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and one</b> blessing <b>afterward, and in the evening one recites two</b> blessings <b>before</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and two afterward?</b> Based upon the above reasoning, the mishna <b>should have taught</b> the blessing recited before and after the <b>evening</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>first.</b>",
                    "The Gemara answers: Indeed, the <b><i>tanna</i> began</b> by discussing the laws regarding the recitation of <b>the evening</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>and then taught</b> the laws regarding the recitation of <b>the morning</b> <i>Shema</i>. <b>Once</b> he <b>was already dealing with the morning</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>he explained the matters of the morning</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>and then explained the matters of the evening</b> <i>Shema</i>.",
                    "The Gemara proceeds to clarify the rest of the mishna. <b>The Master said</b> in the mishna that the beginning of the period when one recites <i>Shema</i> in the evening is <b>when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> However, this does not specify a definitive time. <b>When do the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>? From the time of the emergence of the stars.</b> If that is the case, then <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <b>from the time of the emergence of the stars.</b>",
                    "The Gemara responds: Indeed it would have been simpler to say that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> begins with the emergence of the stars, but the particular expression used by the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> another <b>matter in passing: When do priests partake of their <i>teruma</i>? From the time of the emergence of the stars. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> a new <i>halakha</i> parenthetically: failure to bring an <b>atonement</b> offering <b>does not prevent</b> a priest from eating <i>teruma</i>. In cases where an impure priest is required to immerse himself in a ritual bath and bring an atonement offering, even if he already immersed himself, he is not completely ritually pure until he brings the atonement offering. Nevertheless, he is still permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>. Taught in passing in our mishna, this is articulated fully in a <i>baraita</i>, based on a close reading of the biblical passages. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the laws of ritual impurity, it is said: “One who touches it remains impure until evening. He should not eat of the consecrated items and he must wash his flesh with water. And the sun sets and it is purified. Afterwards, he may eat from the <i>teruma</i>, for it is his bread” (Leviticus 22:6–7). From the passage: <b>“And the sun sets and it is purified,”</b> that the absence of <b>the setting of his sun prevents him from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, but</b> failure to bring <b>the atonement</b> offering <b>does not prevent him from partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> may be inferred.",
                    "The Gemara discusses the proof offered in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> do we know <b>that the</b> phrase: <b>“And the sun sets”</b> refers to <b>the</b> complete <b>setting of the sun,</b> and therefore, <b>“and it is purified”</b> refers to the fact that <b>the day is pure,</b> i.e., and the sun sets and it is purified is one phrase meaning that the sun will set, the air will clear, and the stars will emerge (Rav Hai Gaon)?"
                ],
                [
                    "<b>Perhaps</b> the expression: “And the sun sets and it is purified” refers to the very beginning of sunset, <b>the setting of</b> the sun’s <b>light.</b> According to that explanation, <b>what does</b> the expression <b>and it is purified mean?</b> It means that <b>the person will become purified.</b> After immersing, he will wait until the beginning of sunset, and only then will he be able to eat of his <i>teruma</i> (<i>Tosafot</i>).",
                    "<b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said: If so,</b> that: And it is purified, means that the priest goes and purifies himself, then <b>let the verse say</b> unambiguously: <b>And he will become purified.</b> Since the Torah does not employ that language, the conclusion is: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the expression: <b>And it is purified?</b> It means <b>the day is pure,</b> no residue of day remains, <b>as people say</b> colloquially: <b>The sun has set and the day is purified.</b>",
                    "<b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they did not hear this</b> explanation given <b>by Rabba bar Rav Sheila. They raised the dilemma: Does the expression: And the sun sets, refer to the</b> actual <b>setting of the sun, and does: And it is purified, mean the day clears away? Or perhaps it refers to the setting of its light</b> at sunset, in which case <b>what is</b> the meaning of: <b>And it is purified?</b> It refers to <b>the purification of the person.</b> In other words, in Eretz Yisrael, they attempted to clarify the <i>halakha</i> based on the biblical passage, but were unable to do so.",
                    "<b>Ultimately they resolved</b> this dilemma <b>from a <i>baraita</i>. It was taught in a baraita</b> that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> corresponds to the time when priests are permitted to eat of their <i>teruma</i>, <b>a sign for which is the emergence of the stars.</b> Therefore, <b>derive from here</b> that “and the sun sets” refers to <b>the complete sunset, and the expression “and it is purified”</b> means <b>the day clears away,</b> as the Sages in Babylonia concluded.",
                    "In our mishna, <b>the Master said:</b> The beginning of the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is: <b>From the time when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this opinion from a <i>baraita</i> that states that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is: <b>From when a poor person enters to eat his bread with salt until he rises from his meal.</b>",
                    "The Gemara begins its analysis by clarifying whether there is an actual contradiction here, or whether different expressions are being employed to describe the same time. <b>The latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, which established that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> ends when a poor person rises from his meal, <b>certainly disagrees with our mishna.</b> Since the poor person clearly does not continue eating until the end of the first watch, this <i>baraita</i> certainly contradicts our mishna. With regard to <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, however, which establishes the beginning of the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i>, <b>shall we say that it disagrees with our mishna?</b>",
                    "The Gemara immediately rejects this idea: <b>No,</b> the time when <b>the poor person</b> eats <b>and</b> the time when <b>the priest</b> is purified and permitted to partake of his <i>teruma</i> <b>are one</b> and the same <b>time.</b>",
                    "The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>From when does one begin to recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>in the evening? From the time when people enter to eat their bread on Shabbat eve.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> As they do in our mishna, <b>the Rabbis say: From the time when the priests are eligible to partake of their <i>teruma</i>, a sign for which is the emergence of the stars. And although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof</b> that the emergence of the stars is when one may begin to recite the evening <i>Shema</i>, <b>there is an allusion</b> in the book of Nehemiah to the fact that the emergence of the stars is generally considered the beginning of the night. As <b>it is stated</b> with regard to the building of the walls of Jerusalem: <b>“And we perform the work, and half of them grasp their spears from dawn until the emergence of the stars”</b> (Nehemiah 4:15). <b>And it says: “That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day”</b> (Nehemiah 4:16). From here we ascertain that the day ends with the emergence of the stars.",
                    "Even before analyzing these sources, the Gemara seeks to clarify a confusing element in the <i>Tosefta</i>. In their biblical proof, the Rabbis do not suffice with one verse, but rather they say: And it says…and they cite an additional verse. <b>What</b> is added by this use of: <b>And it says?</b> It seems superfluous, as the entire proof appears in the first verse.",
                    "The Gemara answers that the first verse was not sufficient. <b>As, if you say that night begins when the sun sets, but</b> the workers <b>stayed late and arrived early;</b> i.e., due to the importance of their task they worked even into the night. In anticipation of this objection, the second verse was cited to teach: <b>Come and hear,</b> as it is stated: <b>“That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day,”</b> the time between dawn and the emergence of the stars is explicitly referred to as “day,” proving that night begins with the emergence of the stars.",
                    "In analyzing the three opinions regarding the beginning of the period for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i>, the Gemara begins with the supposition: <b>It might enter your mind</b> to say that the time when the <b>poor person</b> typically eats his meal and the time when ordinary <b>people</b> eat their Shabbat evening meal <b>are one</b> and the same <b>time,</b> since in both cases those eating would seek to begin their meals as early as possible, as, for different reasons, they are unable to kindle additional lights to illuminate their meal. And, <b>if you say</b> that the time of <b>the poor person’s</b> meal <b>and</b> the time when <b>the priest</b> is purified and permitted to partake of his <i>teruma</i> <b>are one</b> and the same <b>time,</b> then the opinion of <b>the Rabbis is</b> identical to that of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> What is their disagreement?",
                    "<b>Rather,</b> what we said previously must be rejected, and instead <b>learn from this</b> that there is <b>a separate time</b> for the <b>poor person and a separate time</b> for the <b>priest.</b> However, this conclusion is based on the assumption that the time of the poor person and the time of people are the same. That too can be rejected with the assertion that, <b>no,</b> the time of the <b>poor person and the priest are one</b> and the same <b>time,</b> and the time of <b>the poor person and people are not the same.</b> Accordingly, the opinion expressed by the <i>tanna</i> in our <i>baraita</i> is identical to that of the other <i>tanna’im</i>, and only Rabbi Meir disagrees with them.",
                    "<b>And is the time of the poor person and the priest the same?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this approach from another <i>baraita</i>, in which other opinions regarding the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> are cited: <b>From when does one begin to recite</b> the <b>evening</b> <i>Shema</i>? <br><b>From the time when the day becomes sanctified on the eve of Shabbat, this is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who established an earlier time for <i>Shema</i>. <br><b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> like our mishna, <b>says: From the time when the priests are eligible to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> <br><b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> begins before the priests were purified, <b>from when the priests immerse themselves in order to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> <br><b>Rabbi Yehuda said to</b> Rabbi Meir: How is it possible that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> corresponds to the time of the priests’ immersion? <b>Do the priests not immerse themselves during the day,</b> so that with nightfall and the onset of a new day they will be purified? If so, how can that time be called night? <br><b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> begins <b>when the poor person enters to eat his bread with salt.</b> <br>But <b>Rabbi Aḥai, and some say Rabbi Aḥa, says: From the time when most people enter to recline</b> at their meal during the week.",
                    "The preceding was the text of the <i>baraita</i>. Returning to our question, <b>if you say</b> that <b>the time of the poor person and the priest are one</b> and the same <b>time,</b> then the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina is</b> identical to that of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua.</b> However, the fact that they are cited together indicates that they are not, in fact, the same.",
                    "<b>Rather, must</b> one <b>not conclude from this the time for</b> the <b>poor person is separate and the time for</b> the <b>priest is separate?</b> Since no objection is raised, the Gemara concedes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this.</b>",
                    "Having established that the time of the poor person and that of the priest are different, the Gemara seeks to determine: <b>which one is later?</b> The Gemara suggests that <b>it is reasonable</b> to conclude that <b>the</b> time of the <b>poor person is later. As if you say</b> that <b>the poor person is earlier,</b> it would be impossible to establish a time earlier than that established by Rabbi Yehoshua, unless we hold that night begins with sunset, in which case the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina is</b> identical to that of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. Rather, must</b> one <b>not conclude from this that the poor person is later?</b> The Gemara notes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this.</b>",
                    "We learned that <b>the Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> according to Rabbi Meir begins with the time of the immersion of the priests. Regarding this, <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> to Rabbi Meir: <b>Do the priests not immerse themselves during the day?</b>",
                    "The Gemara notes: <b>What Rabbi Yehuda said to Rabbi Meir seems correct,</b> and how can Rabbi Meir respond? Rabbi Meir’s response is connected to the fundamental dispute over when night begins. After sunset, a period begins which is neither day nor night. The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree over the precise duration of this period known as twilight [<i>bein hashemashot</i>]. Rabbi Yehuda holds that twilight extends a full hour after sunset. Rabbi Neḥemya agrees in principle, though he disagrees over the specifics. Rabbi Yosei maintains that twilight is very brief, and occurs immediately before the emergence of the stars, which marks the beginning of the night. Regarding Rabbi Meir’s argument, Rabbi Yehuda asks that since the priests immerse themselves before twilight, they have a long wait until nightfall; clearly their immersion takes place while it is still day.",
                    "The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Meir said</b> to Rabbi Yehuda <b>as follows</b>: <b>Do you maintain that I am speaking of your</b> definition of <b>twilight? I am speaking of Rabbi Yosei’s</b> definition of <b>twilight, as Rabbi Yosei said: Twilight is like the blink of an eye;</b> night <b>begins and</b> day <b>ends and</b> the time between them is so brief, <b>it is impossible to quantify.</b> According to this opinion, the priests immerse themselves just before the emergence of the stars, when it is already considered night."
